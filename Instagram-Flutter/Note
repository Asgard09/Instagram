1. Widgets
Everything in Flutter is a widget
Two types:
    StatelessWidget: UI that doesn't change(Text, icon,...)
    StatefulWidget: UI that can change over time (forms, toggle buttons,...)
Widgets describe what their view should look like

2. State Management
Controls how the UI updates when data changes
